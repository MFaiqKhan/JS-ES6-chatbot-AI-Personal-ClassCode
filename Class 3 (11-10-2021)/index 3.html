        //data types are copied.Primitive data types are passed, or copied, by value and are immutable, meaning that the existing value cannot be altered the way an array or an object can. we overwrote the value of num2 but num1 
        //remains same.


        
        
        

        //------- Reference type Values are : objects, arrays and functions are passed by reference and point to a location in memory for the value, not the value itself.
        

        //---Below array Both a and b point to a (made up) address in memory which stores a reference to the object
        //and both addresses are same.so they both will change if even one is change, but if we want to change then what?
        // Then we have to change the address of the second and we can change it by applying the bracket with concat .
