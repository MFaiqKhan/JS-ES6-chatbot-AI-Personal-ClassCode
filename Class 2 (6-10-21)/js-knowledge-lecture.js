//The size of JavaScript string is 2 bytes per character, because
//string is represented in ASCII(American Standard Code For Information Interchange).

//when humans discovered science and try to evolve in it
//humans knew insulater and conductor (early age)
//then they discovered 3rd type of material, which have a characteristic of changing itself to 
//either insulater or conductor named (semi-conductor)
//semi-conductors have the characteristic to hold it's applied property
//then mathematician develop the binary number system in them.
//8bit = 1 byte = 255 numbers(maximum numbers can be stored) 
//2 bytes contain 65536 numbers(can be stored)
//bits are multiplying by itself and 4 bytes will contain around 4 billion numbers
//string is represented in character set named ASCII
//ASCII character takes 1 byte 



//so javascript by default, follow UTF-16 character set,In UTF-16  one character takes 2 bytes in memory
//unicode takes 4 bytes each character (contains many emojis, many languages etc)
//one index in array , every index we can say is acting as a seperate variable, 
//In array the bytes are calculated according to it's index
//boolean takes 1 bit.
