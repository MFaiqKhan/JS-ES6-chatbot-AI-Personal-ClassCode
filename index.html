        //function js mai jagah is wajah sai nai leta , because function ain't create a variable and in variable whole
        //function is placed there, jahan per function kai naam arha ho wahan per vo function ko poora poora rakh raha hota hai, 
        //function itself don't work, it's instance/copy is created and process and it destroy after the func is finished.
        //after it is destroyed, and the copy takes space in memory, and then after it is destroyed the function memory is also cleared.
        //pure function can be depend and accessed by it's args 
        //impure function have external variable defined. impurity can be made by requesting a data from the internet etc.
        //server side code is very critical, as server is running differenty in different pc at different time, so
        //performance do a number on server, overall all the user using server effect the performance of the server, so don't write the extra code you don't need.
        //pure function can be predicted by their defined parameters.

        //four ways to write a func in js;

        // named function syntax : function myFunction(){}     //It have hoisting perform.

        // anonymouse function :    It should be declared by a variable or be called in an instant, if don't it will
        // not be accessible.  let func = function(){}

        // arrow func:    let func = () => {}

        //arrow func with no body just return :   const func = (a,b) => (a,b);
